#Welcome to the world of The Elderly Scrolls

This a basic game that requires the arrow keys to interact with each decision.

Starting this mini adventure, you will choose a hero, each equipped with their own character class and race making them unique as you pass through this post retirement fantasy land.  Players will them be able to interact with NPCs which will give them a slew of quests to choose from.  The player can then choose to look at their quest log and complete quests at their own leisure.  It's your retirement, do you, and when you are finished you may press exit where prompted, and the game will be over.
